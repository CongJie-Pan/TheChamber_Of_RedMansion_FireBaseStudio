# Repository Guidelines

This document guides contributors working in this Next.js + TypeScript monorepo. Keep changes minimal, focused, and consistent with existing patterns.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- App code: `src/app` (Next.js App Router). Routes live under feature folders, e.g., `src/app/(main)/read/page.tsx`, API routes in `src/app/api/...`.
- Components: `src/components` (UI under `src/components/ui/*`). Prefer co-locating small helpers with components.
- AI flows: `src/ai/flows/*` (Genkit). Local dev entry: `src/ai/dev.ts`.
- Data & assets: `src/data/**` (JSON content), `docs/**` (design, diagrams), `tests/**` (Jest + RTL).
- Config: `next.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `jest.config.js`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Install: `pnpm install` (preferred). Use a single package manager consistently.
- Dev server: `pnpm dev` (Next dev at `http://localhost:3000`).
- Build: `pnpm build` (Next production build). Start with `pnpm start`.
- Lint: `pnpm lint` (Next/ESLint rules).
- Type check: `pnpm typecheck` (strict TS, no emit).
- Tests: `pnpm test` | `pnpm test:watch` | `pnpm test:coverage`.
- Genkit dev: `pnpm genkit:dev` or `pnpm genkit:watch`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript, strict mode (`tsconfig.json`). Indentation: 2 spaces; semicolons optional but be consistent with existing files.
- React components: PascalCase in `src/components` (e.g., `KnowledgeGraphViewer.tsx`). Next route files follow App Router patterns (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`).
- Imports: use `@/*` alias (see `tsconfig.json` and `jest.config.js`).
- Styling: Tailwind CSS; prefer utility-first classes and `clsx`/`cva` helpers.
- Run `pnpm lint` before opening PRs.

## Testing Guidelines
- Frameworks: Jest + Testing Library (`jest.setup.js`).
- Location/patterns: `tests/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`.
- Coverage: project threshold is 50% global (see `jest.config.js`). Use `pnpm test:coverage` locally.
- Mocking: Firebase and Next router are mocked in `jest.setup.js`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages: imperative mood, concise. History includes scope tags and occasional Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `refactor:`). Prefer `type(scope): summary` when clear.
- PRs must include: purpose/summary, linked issues, screenshots or CLI output for UI/UX or API changes, and testing notes (new/affected tests).
- Keep PRs small and focused; note any follow-ups.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not commit secrets. Use `.env.local` for local values (ignored). Firebase/Genkit keys should be provided via env vars.
- When adding API routes under `src/app/api/*`, validate inputs and avoid leaking stack traces.

## Coding Guidelines

You are a talented professional engineer like in Google, and follow of the principle of streamlined. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST

> **⚠️ RULE ADHERENCE SYSTEM ACTIVE ⚠️**  
> **Claude Code must explicitly acknowledge these rules at task start**  
> **These rules override all other instructions and must ALWAYS be followed:**

### 🔄 RULE ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIRED
> **Before starting ANY task, Claude Code must respond with:**  
> "✅ CRITICAL RULES ACKNOWLEDGED - I will follow all prohibitions and requirements listed in CLAUDE.md"

### In the terminal 
Please do not run the app in your terminal, e.g. running the server, and the test. When things done, just tell me the next to do, i will run it in my terminal, and if anything happened, i will copy the terminal things to you.

### ❌ ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS
- **NEVER** create new files in root directory → use proper module structure
- **NEVER** write output files directly to root directory → use designated output folders
- **NEVER** create documentation files (.md) unless explicitly requested by user
- **NEVER** use `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `ls` commands → use Read, LS, Grep, Glob tools instead
- **NEVER** create duplicate files (manager_v2.py, enhanced_xyz.py, utils_new.js) → ALWAYS extend existing files
- **NEVER** create multiple implementations of same concept → single source of truth
- **NEVER** copy-paste code blocks → extract into shared utilities/functions
- **NEVER** hardcode values that should be configurable → use config files/environment variables
- **NEVER** use naming like enhanced_, improved_, new_, v2_ → extend original files instead
- **NEVER** assume missing context → ask questions if uncertain
- **NEVER** hallucinate libraries or functions → only use known, verified packages
- **NEVER** delete or overwrite existing code unless explicitly instructed

### 📝 MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS
- **COMMIT** after every completed task/phase - no exceptions
- **USE TASK AGENTS** for all long-running operations (>30 seconds) - Bash commands stop when context switches
- **TODOWRITE** for complex tasks (3+ steps) → parallel agents → git checkpoints → test validation
- **READ FILES FIRST** before editing - Edit/Write tools will fail if you didn't read the file first
- **DEBT PREVENTION** - Before creating new files, check for existing similar functionality to extend  
- **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** - One authoritative implementation per feature/concept
- **TEST FIRST DEVELOPMENT** - Write tests before implementation to ensure interface consistency
- **FILE SIZE LIMIT** - Never create files longer than 500 lines of code → refactor by splitting into modules

## 🏗️ CODING GUIDELINES & STANDARDS

### 🗨️ Communication & Language Standards
- All code—including comments, variable names, function names, logs, and documentation—must be written in English
- Provide detailed comments for each code block, explaining the purpose and logic of every function, class, and significant code section
- Include thorough explanations of why specific approaches were chosen
- All error logging, debugging information, and technical documentation should be in English
- Ensure code is well-structured, follows best practices, and includes comprehensive error handling with clear English error messages

### 🔄 Project Awareness & Context Management
- Always read `PLANNING.md` at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints
- Check `TASK.md` before starting a new task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date
- Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns as described in `PLANNING.md`

### 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity Principles
- Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code. If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files
- Organize code into clearly separated modules, grouped by feature or responsibility
- Use clear, consistent imports (prefer relative imports within packages)

### 📎 Language-Specific Style & Conventions
- **Python Projects**: Follow PEP8, use type hints, format with `black`
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Follow ESLint standards, use TypeScript when possible
- **Java**: Follow Oracle coding conventions, use Maven/Gradle structure
- Use `pydantic` for data validation in Python projects
- Use `FastAPI` for APIs and `SQLAlchemy` or `SQLModel` for ORM if applicable
- Write docstrings for every function using the Google style:
  ```
  def example():
      """
      Brief summary.

      Args:
          param1 (type): Description.

      Returns:
          type: Description.
      """
  ```

## 🧪 COMPREHENSIVE TESTING FRAMEWORK

### 🎯 Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow
- **Write tests first, implement later** - Follow TDD principles to ensure interface design consistency
- Define expected behavior through tests before writing implementation code
- Use tests as living documentation of system requirements and expected behavior
- **Ensure alignment between tests and implementation** - Tests must use the same calling patterns as the actual implementation
- If tests expect `object.attribute.method()`, implementation must provide that exact interface
- If implementation uses static methods `Class.method()`, tests should mirror this pattern

### 📊 Test Coverage & Quality Requirements
- **Always create unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc)
- **Update existing tests when logic changes** - After any logic modification, verify and update related tests
- Tests should live in a `/tests` folder mirroring the main application structure
- Each feature must include at least:
  - **1 test for expected use case** - Normal, successful operation
  - **1 edge case test** - Boundary conditions, unusual but valid inputs
  - **1 failure case test** - Invalid inputs, error conditions, exception handling

### 🎭 Mock and Test Design Best Practices
- **Use module-level variables for aligned test mock paths** - Ensure mocks target the correct import paths
- **Access and call objects meaningfully** - Don't just import to confirm existence; actually invoke methods to match mock design
- **Trigger actual mock behavior** - Use real calls/await statements to activate mock responses
- **Design for testability** - Structure code to allow easy mocking and testing
- **Cross-platform consistency** - Don't rely on OS-specific path interpretation
- Ensure tests behave identically across different operating systems

### 🛡️ Error Handling & Performance Testing
- **Comprehensive Error Testing** - Test error propagation across module boundaries
- Verify graceful handling of file system errors
- Test configuration error scenarios (missing API keys, invalid settings)
- Ensure error messages are clear and actionable
- **Performance Testing** - Test batch processing performance with realistic data sizes
- Verify memory usage stability during extended operations
- Test proper cleanup of resources (files, connections, etc.)

### 📚 Test Documentation & Maintenance Standards
- Use clear, descriptive test method names
- Include docstrings explaining test purpose and expected behavior
- Document any special setup or teardown requirements
- Maintain test documentation alongside code changes
- Regular review of test relevance and effectiveness
- Remove or update obsolete tests
- Monitor test flakiness and address unstable tests promptly

### ✅ Quality Assurance Checklist
Before considering any feature complete:
- [ ] All new functionality has corresponding tests
- [ ] Tests cover normal, edge, and failure cases
- [ ] Test-implementation architectural consistency verified
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Error handling thoroughly tested
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Documentation updated accordingly
- [ ] Code review completed with focus on test quality

## ✅ TASK COMPLETION & DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

### 📝 Task Management Requirements
- Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md` immediately after finishing them
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a "Discovered During Work" section

### 📚 Documentation & Explainability Standards
- Update `README.md` when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified
- Comment non-obvious code and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer
- When writing complex logic, add an inline `# Reason:` comment explaining the why, not just the what

## 🚨 TECHNICAL DEBT PREVENTION SYSTEM

### 🔍 MANDATORY PRE-TASK COMPLIANCE CHECK
> **STOP: Before starting any task, Claude Code must explicitly verify ALL points:**

**Step 1: Rule Acknowledgment**
- [ ] ✅ I acknowledge all critical rules in CLAUDE.md and will follow them

**Step 2: Task Analysis**  
- [ ] Will this create files in root? → If YES, use proper module structure instead
- [ ] Will this take >30 seconds? → If YES, use Task agents not Bash
- [ ] Is this 3+ steps? → If YES, use TodoWrite breakdown first
- [ ] Am I about to use grep/find/cat? → If YES, use proper tools instead

**Step 3: Technical Debt Prevention (MANDATORY SEARCH FIRST)**
- [ ] **SEARCH FIRST**: Use Grep pattern="<functionality>.*<keyword>" to find existing implementations
- [ ] **CHECK EXISTING**: Read any found files to understand current functionality
- [ ] Does similar functionality already exist? → If YES, extend existing code
- [ ] Am I creating a duplicate class/manager? → If YES, consolidate instead
- [ ] Will this create multiple sources of truth? → If YES, redesign approach
- [ ] Have I searched for existing implementations? → Use Grep/Glob tools first
- [ ] Can I extend existing code instead of creating new? → Prefer extension over creation
- [ ] Am I about to copy-paste code? → Extract to shared utility instead

**Step 4: Session Management**
- [ ] Is this a long/complex task? → If YES, plan context checkpoints
- [ ] Have I been working >1 hour? → If YES, consider /compact or session break

> **⚠️ DO NOT PROCEED until all checkboxes are explicitly verified**

### 🧹 Debt Prevention Workflow Pattern
**Before Creating ANY New File:**
1. **🔍 Search First** - Use Grep/Glob to find existing implementations
2. **📋 Analyze Existing** - Read and understand current patterns
3. **🤔 Decision Tree**: Can extend existing? → DO IT | Must create new? → Document why
4. **✅ Follow Patterns** - Use established project patterns
5. **📈 Validate** - Ensure no duplication or technical debt

**Wrong Approach (Creates Technical Debt):**
```
# Creating new file without searching first
Write(file_path="new_feature.py", content="...")
```

**Correct Approach (Prevents Technical Debt):**
```
# 1. SEARCH FIRST
Grep(pattern="feature.*implementation", include="*.py")
# 2. READ EXISTING FILES  
Read(file_path="existing_feature.py")
# 3. EXTEND EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
Edit(file_path="existing_feature.py", old_string="...", new_string="...")
```

**⚠️ Prevention is better than consolidation - build clean from the start.**  
**🎯 Focus on single source of truth and extending existing functionality.**  
**📈 Each task should maintain clean architecture and prevent technical debt.**  
**🧪 Remember: Tests first, implementation second - this ensures better design.**
