I need you to plan to write unit and integration tests for this, and following Google's testing best practices:

### Unit Tests

1. Test behaviors, not implementation details
2. Use public APIs only - avoid testing internal/private methods
3. Test state changes, not interactions
4. Make tests complete and concise - each test should be self-contained
5. Write clear, descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
6. Avoid logic in tests (no if/else, loops, or complex conditionals)
7. Include clear failure messages that explain what went wrong
8. Focus on one behavior per test

Requirements:
- Cover happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
- Ensure tests are deterministic and won't be flaky
- Make assertions specific and meaningful
- Keep setup minimal and focused

### Integration Tests

1. Test realistic end-to-end workflows through public APIs
2. Verify interactions between multiple components/services
3. Use test data that resembles production scenarios
4. Test failure modes: network timeouts, service unavailability, partial failures
5. Verify data flow across system boundaries
6. Test concurrent operations and race conditions where applicable
7. Ensure tests are isolated and can run independently
8. Use realistic configuration similar to production

Success criteria:
- All critical user journeys should pass
- Error handling should be verified
- Performance characteristics should be within acceptable ranges
