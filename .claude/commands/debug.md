Read the "docs\structure_module_infoMD\project_structure.md" first, and please according to the bug provided, and the output to plan the debugging plan.To describe with the traditional chinese (ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá)  please just planning for me, and wait for my confrim for the implementation :

## üîç Current Issue Status (5W1H)
**What**: [One-sentence description of the bug]  
**When**: [Trigger time + Git commit/PR]  
**Where**: [File path + line number where the error occurs]  
**Expected vs. Actual**:  
  - Expected: [Desired behavior]  
  - Actual: [Current erroneous behavior]  
**Full Stack Trace**:  

## üìã Context Loading  
@[Primary error file] @[Relevant test files] @[Recently modified files]  
**Recent Changes**: [Relevant commits]  
**Related Issues/PRs**: [Links]

## üß† Root Cause Analysis (Think Hard)  
Please use "think harder" mode for deep analysis and explore using the following methods:  
1. **5 Whys Analysis**: Starting from the error message, ask "why" five times consecutively.  
2. **Binary Search**: Identify the last known good commit.  
3. **Dependency Chain Tracing**: List all affected modules/functions.

Provide 3 hypotheses, each including:  
- [ ] **Hypothesis A**: [Description]  
  - Likelihood: [High/Medium/Low]  
  - Scope of Changes: [X files, Y lines of code]  
  - Breaking Risk: [Score 1‚Äì5]  
  - Estimated Fix Time: [Completable within ‚â§30 minutes]  

- [ ] **Hypothesis B**: [Description]  
  - Likelihood: [High/Medium/Low]  
  - Scope of Changes: [X files, Y lines of code]  
  - Breaking Risk: [Score 1‚Äì5]  
  - Estimated Fix Time: [Completable within ‚â§30 minutes]  

- [ ] **Hypothesis C**: [Description]  
  - Likelihood: [High/Medium/Low]  
  - Scope of Changes: [X files, Y lines of code]  
  - Breaking Risk: [Score 1‚Äì5]  
  - Estimated Fix Time: [Completable within ‚â§30 minutes]  

## ‚úÖ Implementation Plan (Recommended Approach)  
**Selected Option**: [A/B/C] **Reason**: [One-sentence justification]

### Execution Steps  
- [ ] **Step 1**: Validate hypothesis ‚Äì [Specific validation method]  
  - Expected Outcome: [Success criteria]  
  - Fallback Plan: [Plan B if validation fails]  

- [ ] **Step 2**: Modify `[file path]` ‚Äì [Specific changes]  
  - Impact Scope: [List all dependent files]  

- [ ] **Step 3**: Run tests `[test command]`  
  - Required Passing Tests: [List]  
  - Regression Test Coverage: [%]  

- [ ] **Step 4**: Manual Verification ‚Äì [Step-by-step instructions]

### Safety Checks  
- [ ] All existing tests pass  
- [ ] No new linter warnings introduced  
- [ ] API remains backward compatible  
- [ ] No performance regression (<5% difference)
