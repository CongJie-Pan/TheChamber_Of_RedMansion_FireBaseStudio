/**
 * @fileOverview AI Writing Coach Page - Intelligent Writing Assistance Features [REMOVED]
 * 
 * This page was originally designed to provide AI-powered writing assistance specifically
 * tailored for literary analysis and creative writing related to the Dream of the Red Chamber.
 * It would have served as a comprehensive writing support system for students and scholars.
 * 
 * Status: REMOVED - Feature discontinued during development scope refinement
 * 
 * Original intended functionality:
 * - AI-powered essay structure and outline generation
 * - Literary analysis writing assistance with contextual suggestions
 * - Grammar and style checking optimized for academic writing
 * - Citation formatting and reference management integration
 * - Template generation for different types of literary analysis
 * - Real-time writing feedback and improvement suggestions
 * - Character analysis writing prompts and scaffolding
 * - Poetry and creative writing tools inspired by Red Chamber themes
 * 
 * AI writing features that were planned:
 * - Contextual writing prompts based on current reading progress
 * - Automatic theme identification and analysis suggestions
 * - Style consistency checking for academic papers
 * - Plagiarism detection and originality verification
 * - Multi-language writing support (Chinese, English)
 * - Integration with note-taking system for evidence gathering
 * - Collaborative writing features for group projects
 * - Export capabilities to various academic formats (LaTeX, Word, PDF)
 * 
 * Educational writing support:
 * - Scaffolded writing instruction from basic to advanced levels
 * - Genre-specific templates (literary analysis, creative response, research papers)
 * - Progress tracking for writing skill development
 * - Peer review and feedback collection systems
 * - Writing goal setting and achievement tracking
 * - Integration with gamification system for writing motivation
 * 
 * Technical considerations for AI integration:
 * - Natural language processing for content analysis
 * - Machine learning models trained on literary criticism examples
 * - Real-time grammar and style checking APIs
 * - Version control for drafts and revisions
 * - Cloud synchronization for cross-device writing
 * - Advanced text editor with rich formatting capabilities
 * 
 * Educational value:
 * - Would have supported development of critical writing skills
 * - Provided personalized feedback for writing improvement
 * - Facilitated transition from reading comprehension to analytical writing
 * - Supported both creative and academic writing development
 * 
 * Reason for removal: Complex AI writing assistance requires significant development
 * resources and sophisticated NLP models. Priority shifted to core reading features
 * and community interaction rather than advanced writing tools.
 * 
 * Future restoration guidance:
 * If this feature is to be restored, consider:
 * 1. Starting with basic writing prompts and templates
 * 2. Integrating with existing AI flows for contextual assistance
 * 3. Building on note-taking features already present in read-book page
 * 4. Focusing on literary analysis rather than general writing assistance
 * 5. Leveraging existing Gemini AI integration for text generation
