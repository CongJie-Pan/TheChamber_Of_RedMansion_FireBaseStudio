/**
 * @fileOverview Learning Goals Management Page - Personalized Goal Setting System [REMOVED]
 * 
 * This page was originally designed to provide a comprehensive goal-setting and tracking
 * system for personalized learning journeys through the Dream of the Red Chamber.
 * It would have enabled users to create, manage, and track their individual learning
 * objectives with detailed progress monitoring and achievement recognition.
 * 
 * Status: REMOVED - Feature consolidated into achievements page for simplified UX
 * 
 * Original intended functionality:
 * - Personalized learning goal creation and customization
 * - Progress tracking with visual indicators and milestone celebrations
 * - Adaptive goal suggestions based on reading history and preferences
 * - Time-based objectives with deadline management and reminders
 * - Skill-specific goals (reading comprehension, cultural knowledge, literary analysis)
 * - Social goal sharing and collaborative objectives
 * - Achievement integration with reward and badge systems
 * - Analytics and insights for goal completion patterns
 * 
 * Goal categories that were planned:
 * - Reading Progress Goals (chapters, time-based, completion targets)
 * - Comprehension Goals (quiz scores, discussion participation, note quality)
 * - Cultural Knowledge Goals (historical context, literary references, character analysis)
 * - Social Learning Goals (community participation, peer interaction, sharing insights)
 * - Creative Goals (writing responses, artistic interpretations, discussions)
 * - Research Goals (source exploration, comparative analysis, academic citations)
 * 
 * Advanced goal management features:
 * - SMART goal framework implementation (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
 * - Adaptive difficulty adjustment based on user performance
 * - Goal dependency management (prerequisite goals, sequential objectives)
 * - Progress visualization with charts, graphs, and timeline views
 * - Automated milestone detection and celebration notifications
 * - Goal sharing and collaborative objectives with friends or study groups
 * - Integration with calendar systems for deadline management
 * - Export capabilities for academic planning and portfolio development
 * 
 * Educational psychology integration:
 * - Motivation theory application through intrinsic and extrinsic goal setting
 * - Self-regulation support through progress monitoring and reflection prompts
 * - Growth mindset encouragement through process-focused goal framing
 * - Metacognitive skill development through goal evaluation and adjustment
 * - Social learning theory application through collaborative goal setting
 * 
 * Technical implementation considerations:
 * - Goal data modeling with flexible schema for different objective types
 * - Progress calculation algorithms for various goal metrics
 * - Notification system for reminders, milestones, and achievements
 * - Analytics engine for goal completion patterns and success factors
 * - Integration APIs with calendar, social, and achievement systems
 * - Data visualization libraries for progress charts and trend analysis
 * 
 * Reason for removal: Feature was determined to overlap significantly with the
 * achievements page functionality. To avoid redundancy and simplify the user
 * experience, goal setting was integrated into the achievements system rather
 * than maintaining a separate dedicated page.
 * 
 * Current implementation: Basic goal functionality is now available within
 * the achievements page, providing essential goal setting without the complexity
 * of a full dedicated management system.
 * 
 * Future restoration guidance:
 * If advanced goal management is needed, consider:
 * 1. Expanding the achievements page with dedicated goal sections
 * 2. Creating a modal-based goal management system within existing pages
 * 3. Implementing goal widgets that can be embedded across different views
 * 4. Focusing on learning-specific goals rather than general task management
 * 5. Ensuring seamless integration with existing progress tracking systems
