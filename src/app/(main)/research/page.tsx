/**
 * @fileOverview Research Tools Page - Advanced Literary Analysis Features [REMOVED]
 * 
 * This page was originally designed to provide advanced scholarly research tools
 * for in-depth literary analysis of the Dream of the Red Chamber. It would have
 * served as a comprehensive research hub for academic study and citation management.
 * 
 * Status: REMOVED - Feature discontinued for scope reduction and prioritization
 * 
 * Original intended functionality:
 * - Advanced search across multiple text editions and commentaries
 * - Citation generation and bibliography management tools
 * - Comparative text analysis between different manuscript versions
 * - Scholarly annotation and reference collection system
 * - Academic paper drafting and collaboration tools
 * - Integration with external academic databases and libraries
 * - Export capabilities for research data and findings
 * - Version control for research notes and drafts
 * 
 * Academic features that were planned:
 * - Cross-referencing system for themes, motifs, and symbols
 * - Statistical analysis of character interactions and plot elements
 * - Timeline construction for narrative events
 * - Thematic mapping and concept clustering
 * - Integration with scholarly databases like JSTOR and Project MUSE
 * - Collaboration tools for research groups and academic institutions
 * 
 * Technical considerations for future implementation:
 * - Full-text search indexing across multiple document formats
 * - RESTful API integration with academic databases
 * - LaTeX and academic citation format support
 * - Real-time collaborative editing capabilities
 * - Advanced filtering and sorting mechanisms for large datasets
 * - PDF generation for research reports and papers
 * 
 * Educational value:
 * - Would have supported graduate-level research and thesis writing
 * - Facilitated comparative literature studies
 * - Enabled systematic approach to textual analysis
 * - Supported evidence-based literary criticism
 * 
 * Reason for removal: Focus shifted to core reading experience and community features
 * rather than advanced academic research tools, which require significant development
 * resources and may have limited appeal to general users.
 * 
 * Future restoration guidance:
 * If this feature is to be restored, prioritize:
 * 1. Integration with existing knowledge graph system
 * 2. Seamless connection to note-taking features
 * 3. Export compatibility with popular academic tools
 * 4. User-friendly interface that doesn't overwhelm casual readers
