/**
 * @fileOverview Modern Relevance Connections Page - Contemporary Context Linking [REMOVED]
 * 
 * This page was originally designed to bridge classical Chinese literature with
 * contemporary life by highlighting the enduring relevance of themes, characters,
 * and moral lessons from the Dream of the Red Chamber in modern society.
 * It would have served as an innovative educational tool connecting past and present.
 * 
 * Status: REMOVED - Feature removed to focus on core literary study features
 * 
 * Original intended functionality:
 * - Interactive exploration of timeless themes in contemporary contexts
 * - Real-world application of moral and philosophical lessons from the novel
 * - Modern parallel analysis between historical and current social issues
 * - Connection of character archetypes to contemporary personality studies
 * - Relevance of family dynamics and social structures in modern society
 * - Economic and political themes reflected in current global situations
 * - Gender roles and women's issues across historical and modern contexts
 * - Environmental and sustainability themes found in classical descriptions
 * 
 * Educational bridging concepts that were planned:
 * - Social Class and Inequality: Jia family wealth vs. modern economic disparity
 * - Gender Studies: Women's roles in Qing Dynasty vs. contemporary feminism
 * - Family Psychology: Traditional family structures vs. modern family dynamics
 * - Economic Systems: Feudal economy vs. modern capitalism and social mobility
 * - Environmental Consciousness: Garden aesthetics vs. modern sustainability
 * - Political Corruption: Government critique in novel vs. contemporary governance
 * - Mental Health: Character psychological profiles vs. modern psychology
 * - Educational Philosophy: Traditional learning vs. modern pedagogical approaches
 * 
 * Interactive features for relevance exploration:

 * - Case study analysis of parallel situations across time periods
 * - Discussion forums for contemporary relevance debates
 * - Multimedia presentations connecting themes to current events
 * - Personal reflection tools for applying lessons to individual life

 * - Academic research integration for scholarly contemporary analysis
 *

 * - Creative writing prompts for contemporary retellings
 * - Business case studies using novel's insights on human nature
 * - Psychology exercises analyzing character motivations in modern context
 * - Social justice projects inspired by novel's social commentary

 * - Social media integration for sharing contemporary connections
 * - Virtual reality experiences placing users in modern parallels to novel scenes
 * - Interactive infographics showing statistical comparisons across time
 * - Podcast integration featuring experts discussing contemporary relevance
 * - Video analysis tools for comparing novel adaptations to modern media
 * 
 * Educational value of contemporary connections:
 * - Increases student engagement by showing practical relevance
 * - Develops critical thinking skills through comparative analysis
 * - Enhances cultural literacy and historical perspective
 * - Promotes global citizenship through universal theme recognition
 * - Supports interdisciplinary learning across literature, history, and social studies
 * 
 * Reason for removal: This feature required extensive research and content creation
 * to maintain relevance and accuracy. The development team decided to focus on
 * core literary analysis and reading comprehension features rather than the
 * complex interdisciplinary connections that this page would have required.
 * 
 * Alternative implementation: Some aspects of contemporary relevance are now
 * integrated into the AI explanation system, which can provide modern context
 * when users ask questions about specific passages or themes.
 * 
 * Future restoration guidance:
 * If contemporary relevance features are to be restored, consider:
 * 1. Starting with simple theme-to-modern-issue mapping
 * 2. Integrating news API feeds for automatic contemporary connection suggestions
 * 3. Creating user-generated content system for sharing personal relevance discoveries
 * 4. Developing partnerships with current events and educational content providers
 * 5. Focusing on universal human themes rather than specific cultural parallels
 * 6. Building on existing AI capabilities to generate contemporary connections automatically
