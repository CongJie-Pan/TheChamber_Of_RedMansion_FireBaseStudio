/**
 * @fileOverview Main Application Layout Component
 * 
 * This layout component serves as the protected area wrapper for all authenticated
 * application pages. It provides authentication guards, route protection, and
 * adaptive layout rendering based on the current page context.
 * 
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - Authentication state management and route protection
 * - Conditional layout rendering based on page requirements
 * - Seamless navigation between different application areas
 * - Consistent theming and styling across protected routes
 * 
 * Layout variations:
 * 1. Default Layout: Uses AppShell with sidebar navigation for most pages
 * 2. Immersive Layout: Full-screen layout for reading experience without distractions
 * 
 * Authentication flow:
 * - Monitors user authentication state via useAuth hook
 * - Automatically redirects unauthenticated users to login page
 * - Provides loading states during authentication checks
 * - Ensures secure access to protected application features
 * 
 * This component implements the security boundary between public and private
 * areas of the application while providing optimal user experience for different
 * use cases within the learning platform.
