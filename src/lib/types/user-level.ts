/**
 * @fileOverview User Level System Type Definitions
 *
 * This file contains all TypeScript type definitions for the gamification
 * user level system "紅樓修行路" (Red Mansion Cultivation Path).
 *
 * The level system provides:
 * - 8-level progression path from visitor to grand master
 * - Experience points (XP) system for tracking progress
 * - Permission-based feature unlocking
 * - Visual rewards (badges, avatar frames, titles)
 * - Attribute points system for skill tracking
 *
 * Design principles:
 * - Clear progression milestones
 * - Meaningful rewards at each level
 * - Permission-based content gating
 * - Visual feedback for achievements
 * - Cultural authenticity (based on Red Chamber themes)
