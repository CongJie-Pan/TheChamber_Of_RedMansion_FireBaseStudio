/**
 * @fileOverview ClientOnly Component
 * 
 * This component ensures that its children are only rendered on the client side,
 * preventing hydration mismatches when server and client rendering differ.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Components that access browser-only APIs (window, document, localStorage)
 * - Dynamic content that changes between server and client
 * - Third-party widgets that modify DOM after loading
 * - Components that depend on user interaction state
 * 
 * This is a common pattern for handling hydration issues in Next.js applications.
