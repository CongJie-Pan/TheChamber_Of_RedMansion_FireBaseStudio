It shows the user's name, email, and avatar, along with the authentication method they used (e.g., Google). It comes in several variants for use in different contexts, such as a full profile page or a compact display in a navigation bar.
*   **Functions:**
    *   `UserProfile(props: UserProfileProps): JSX.Element`: The component that fetches user data from the `useAuth` hook and renders it according to the specified variant.
*   **Key Classes / Constants / Variables:**
    *   `useAuth`: The custom hook that provides the user object and authentication status.

### 4.15. `WindowFrameNavigation.tsx`

*   **Purpose:** This component provides a unique and artistic navigation experience inspired by the "borrowed scenery" (借景) concept from traditional Chinese gardens. It presents navigation items or content previews within geometric frames (like circles or hexagons) that act as "windows" into the content. It uses CSS `clip-path` to create the frame shapes.
*   **Functions:**
    *   `WindowFrameNavigation(props: WindowFrameNavigationProps): React.FC`: The component that renders the grid of window frames and handles hover effects.
*   **Key Classes / Constants / Variables:**
    *   `WindowFrameShape`: A TypeScript type defining the available shapes for the frames (e.g., `circular`, `hexagonal`).
    *   `getClipPath`: An internal helper function that returns the correct CSS `clip-path` value for a given shape.

## 5. System and Data Flow

### 5.1. System Flowchart (Control Flow)

This flowchart represents a typical control flow for an interactive component in this module, such as the `KnowledgeGraphViewer`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Component Mounts] --> B{Has static data prop?};
    B -- Yes --> D[Use provided data];
    B -- No --> C[Fetch dynamic data from service];
    C --> E{Fetch Successful?};
    E -- Yes --> D;
    E -- No --> F[Render Error State];
    D --> G[Initialize Visualization Library e.g., D3.js];
    G --> H[Render SVG/Canvas elements];
    H --> I{User Interaction?};
    I -- e.g., Hover, Click, Drag --> J[Update Component State];
    J --> K[Re-render with updated styles/transforms];
    K --> I;
    I -- No Interaction --> L[Wait for next event];
```

### 5.2. Data Flow Diagram (Data Transformation)

This diagram illustrates the data flow for a component that fetches and displays data, like `PublicNotesTab`.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Input(User Action: View Tab) --> Mod(Component: PublicNotesTab);
    Mod -- Calls `getPublicNotes()` --> Service(notes-service);
    Service -- Fetches from --> DB[(Firebase/Firestore)];
    DB -- Returns Public Notes Array --> Service;
    Service -- Returns Array --> Mod;
    Mod -- Stores in `notes` state --> Filter(Filtering Logic);
    Filter -- Processes `notes` state --> Paginate(Pagination Logic);
    Paginate -- Sliced Array --> Render(NoteCard Components);
    Render -- Displays HTML --> Output(Rendered UI);
```

## 6. Usage Example & Testing

*   **Usage:** These components are imported and used within the application's pages to build features. For example, to use the `NoteCard` and `NoteFilters` on a notes page:
    ```typescript
    // In /src/app/(main)/notes/page.tsx
    import { NoteCard } from '@/components/NoteCard';
    import { NoteFilters } from '@/components/NoteFilters';

    // ... fetch notes, then render
    <NoteFilters notes={allNotes} onFilterChange={setFilteredNotes} />
    {filteredNotes.map(note => <NoteCard key={note.id} note={note} />)}
    ```
*   **Testing:** Components in this module are primarily tested via integration tests using React Testing Library and Jest. Tests are located in the `/tests/components/` directory and focus on rendering the components with mock data, simulating user interactions (clicks, text input), and asserting that the UI updates as expected. Visual regression testing can also be used to catch unintended styling changes.
