# Project Structure & Architectural Overview

## 1. Project Overview

The Chamber of Red Mansion is an AI-powered educational web platform designed to help students and literature enthusiasts explore the Chinese classical novel "Dream of the Red Chamber" (紅樓夢). The platform combines modern AI technology with traditional literature to create an interactive, gamified learning experience that includes intelligent reading assistance, community discussions, daily learning tasks, and comprehensive progress tracking. The primary users are Chinese literature students and enthusiasts who seek a deeper understanding through AI-enhanced analysis, multi-language support, and social learning features.

## 2. Architectural Principles

This project follows a **Component-Driven Architecture with AI Enhancement** pattern, organized around the following core principles:

* **Layered Architecture with Clear Separation of Concerns:**
  * **AI Orchestration Layer** (`/src/ai/`): Isolated AI workflows using direct OpenAI GPT-4-mini and Perplexity Sonar API integration. This separation allows AI capabilities to evolve independently without affecting UI or business logic, with simplified architecture removing framework overhead.
  * **Presentation Layer** (`/src/app/`, `/src/components/`): Next.js 15 App Router with React Server Components for optimal performance and SEO. UI components are isolated in `/src/components/` following atomic design principles.
  * **Business Logic Layer** (`/src/lib/`): Core services handling authentication, content filtering, task management, and user progression. This layer acts as the bridge between UI and data/AI layers.
  * **Data Layer - Dual-Mode Architecture** (`/src/lib/repositories/`, Firebase): Hybrid data persistence using SQLite for local-first operations with Firebase Firestore fallback for cloud synchronization. Services attempt SQLite operations first for optimal performance, automatically falling back to Firebase if SQLite is unavailable or fails, ensuring reliability while maintaining backward compatibility.

* **Service-Oriented Architecture for Business Logic:**
  * Each service in `/src/lib/` is a self-contained module with a single responsibility (e.g., `daily-task-service.ts`, `community-service.ts`, `content-filter-service.ts`).
  * Services communicate through well-defined interfaces and are independently testable.
  * This modularity enables parallel development and easier maintenance.

* **Repository Pattern for Data Access:**
  * Data access logic is isolated in repository modules (`/src/lib/repositories/`) separating database operations from business logic.
  * Repositories use prepared statements for SQL injection prevention and provide consistent CRUD interfaces across different data types.
  * This abstraction enables database migrations, simplifies testing with in-memory SQLite, and allows services to remain agnostic of underlying storage implementation.

* **AI-First Design Philosophy:**
  * AI capabilities are not bolted on but deeply integrated into the core user experience.
  * Each AI flow in `/src/ai/flows/` represents a specific educational use case (text explanation, character analysis, task generation, etc.).
  * AI is used for content generation, assessment, and personalization throughout the platform.

* **Test-Driven Quality Assurance:**
  * Comprehensive test coverage (77.37% overall services, 100% pass rate with 146+ tests including repository layer) ensures reliability.
  * Tests mirror the `/src` structure in `/tests`, making it easy to locate and maintain test files.
  * Critical services like content filtering, community management, and data repositories have extensive test suites with 75+ repository-specific tests.

* **Internationalization by Design:**
  * Multi-language support (Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, English) is built into the architecture from the ground up.
  * Translation system (`/src/lib/translations.ts`) with 1000+ keys ensures complete coverage.
  * Language context is available globally through React Context API.
