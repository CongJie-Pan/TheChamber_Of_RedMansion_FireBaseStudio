## Testing Standards Applied Across All Modules

### Test Structure Pattern
```typescript
describe('ModuleName', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Initialize service
    // Reset mocks
    // Setup Firebase mocks
  });

  describe('Feature Category - Expected Use Cases', () => {
    it('should handle normal operation', async () => {
      // Arrange: Setup test data
      // Act: Execute function
      // Assert: Verify behavior
    });
  });

  describe('Feature Category - Edge Cases', () => {
    it('should handle boundary conditions', async () => {
      // Test edge inputs
    });
  });

  describe('Feature Category - Failure Cases', () => {
    it('should handle errors gracefully', async () => {
      // Test error scenarios
    });
  });
});
```

### Common Mock Patterns
* **Firebase Mocks:** collection, doc, getDoc, getDocs, addDoc, updateDoc, deleteDoc, query, where, orderBy, limit, serverTimestamp, Timestamp
* **AI Mocks:** OpenAI API, Perplexity API, GenKit flows
* **Network Mocks:** fetch, EventSource for SSE

### Coverage Metrics
* **Overall:** 77.37%
* **Top Performers:**
  * content-filter-service.test.ts: 91.51%
  * translations.test.ts: ~100%
  * knowledgeGraphUtils.test.ts: ~100%
* **Minimum Targets:** 50% (branches, functions, lines, statements)

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific module
npm test -- tests/lib/[module-name].test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

---

## Test Quality Indicators

### Positive Patterns Observed
✓ Clear test names describing expected behavior
✓ Comprehensive AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
✓ Proper mock isolation and cleanup
✓ Edge case and error handling coverage
✓ Performance benchmarks where applicable
✓ Real-world scenario testing
✓ Cross-platform consistency

### Areas for Potential Enhancement
* Some modules lack dedicated test files (API routes)
* Integration tests could be expanded
* E2E testing coverage not visible in unit tests
* Performance tests limited to select modules
